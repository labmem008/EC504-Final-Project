# EC504-Final-Project
## Project Proposal
Team members:
Hanming Wang, Yaopu Wang
Project title:
Locality-sensitive hashing and KD-Tree.
Background:
It is prohibitive to apply any brute-force algorithm to searching problems these days. In this project, we plan to research two classical types of algorithms. Locality-sensitive hashing is a technique that hashes similar input items into the same "buckets" with high probability. The K-dimensional tree is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space.
Goal:
We plan to take advantage of the various third-party libraries of Python to implement the algorithms. We will implement LSH and KD-Tree. We will analyze their speed and accuracy and test them with an online database.
